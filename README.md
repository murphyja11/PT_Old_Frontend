1) Is it easier to build the habit of living mindfully by doing 1 10m meditation session a day, or 5 1m meditations? 
    Is there a benefit of a few reminders to be mindful throughout the day, as opposed to once at the beginning or end?
    
2) You are what you do consistently -> Consistency is the most important factor in seeing benefits from mindfulness.
    Can you make mindfulness habits easier to stick to/more engaging by recommending a personalized meditation given someone's
    past behavior/preferences and their current state? (ie current health data/activity)
